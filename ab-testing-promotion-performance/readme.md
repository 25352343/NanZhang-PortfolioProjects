# A/B Testing for Promotion Performance

This project demonstrates an end-to-end A/B testing workflow to evaluate whether
improving promotional card content can increase user engagement and conversion
in a consumer app context.

The focus is on experiment design, metric definition, statistical testing,
and business interpretation rather than UI or product implementation.

## Project Scope

- Control vs Treatment A/B experiment (50/50 split)
- Simulated user-level experiment data
- CTR as primary metric, CVR as downstream metric
- Statistical significance testing (proportion Z-test)
- Segmentation analysis by user type (new vs returning)
